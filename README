CDMon Updater
============

This is just another CDMon client to update dynamic DNS.
It's written in Ruby and built as a gem.
The main goal for this client is to support multiple users and to provide a flexible configuration.

INSTALL
=======

You can install it as a gem doing
  sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com #only if you haven't done this before
  sudo gem install kandalf-cdmon_updater

Or you can clone the repository from git://github.com/kandalf/cdmon_updater.git
and put bin/cdmon_updater somewhere in your PATH.

After the installation you should create the file /etc/cdmon.yml with a structure like this:

general:
  dns:          dinamic1.cdmon.net
  email:        root@server
  log_level:    DEBUG
  service_url:  https://dinamico.cdmon.org/onlineService.php

users:
  cdmon_user:
    hosts: domain1.com domainX.com
    md5pass: 1278323gfb37875f2749ju6cabd8io89

You should customize the users section with your personal data. The cdmon_user should be replaced with the user you have associated in your CDMon control panel with your domains.
As you can have multiple users in CDMon, you can add as many user sections as you need here.
The md5pass should be the user's password crypted as an MD5 hash, CDMon provides a website to do this (https://www.cdmon.com/webapps/encriptar.php) but you can use the method you like as long as it results on the MD5 hash for your passowrd.

From the general section you should customizde the log_level and the email (which is not yet supported but it will be soon).
